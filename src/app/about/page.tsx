                <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
                    <strong>ModShop</strong> is a simple e-commerce mock web application built for an educational
                    scenario in a Master&#39;s level course on <em>Designing Human-Centered AI Systems</em>.
                    It is designed not just to allow simulating online purchases, but to study how
                    <strong> algorithmic nudges</strong> can influence user behavior in a shopping context.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    The core objective is to <strong>minimize impulsive purchases</strong> by implementing nudges
                    such as:

                    <li>Confirmation prompts before purchase completion</li>
                    <li>Purchase lock timers requiring a pause before finalizing orders</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    The frontend is developed using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind
                    CSS</strong> with
                    <strong> Next.js App Router</strong>. Products are organized into categories such as clothing,
                    video games, books, and household items.

                <p className="mb-4">
